# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository features five classic sorting algorithms implemented in C, each designed to sort an array of integers. The code is modular, allowing for easy testing and comparison of performance.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.
- **Selection Sort** – Finds the smallest element in each pass and places it in the correct position.
- **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements in the correct position.
- **Merge Sort** – Recursively divides the array and merges sorted subarrays.
- **Quick Sort** – Uses a pivot to partition and recursively sort subarrays.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need a C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) to run these algorithms.

### Compilation
To compile the code, use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c -o sort
